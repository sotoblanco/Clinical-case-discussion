## Infectious Disease

**A 68-year-old woman presented to the clinic with a 5-day history of rash, fevers, chills, myalgias, and fatigue.**

> The rahs, fever, chills, myalgias and fatigue are common symptoms of infectious disease so we need to explore in the clinical history patterns on his behaviour such as where he work, if there are any insect that can be the cause of the disease

**She lived in Japan and had been bitten by a tick on her right ankle 1 week before the onset of symptoms.**

> Now that we identify the potential vector of the disease we should explore for common disease given by the bite of a tick. There are a lot of potential disease, and can be depending on the type of tick. 
> - Deer tick: lyme disease

> Based on the type of lesion this patient probably have a  Rocky Mountain spotted fever and the bite probably came from the lone start tick

**The rash, which initially had a maculopapular appearance, had erupted abruptly on her arms and legs and had progressed to petechial lesions that also involved the trunk**

> The rash shows patterns related to rocky mountain spotted fever. The clinical examination involves the assesment of the fever and the lesion on the body, and finally PCR to identify and confirm the diagnoses

**On examination, the patient’s temperature was 39.2°C. There was a petechial rash on the trunk, arms, legs, palms, and soles (Panels A and B) and an eschar on the right medial ankle (Panel A, inset). She was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and monitoring.**

> Laboratory studies also can be made to asses the state of the patient such as platelet count, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase

**Laboratory studies showed elevated inflammatory markers, a platelet count of 56,000 per cubic millimeter (reference range, 158,000 to 348,000), an alanine aminotransferase level of 98 U per liter (reference range, 10 to 42), and an aspartate aminotransferase level of 165 U per liter (reference range, 13 to 30).**

> The laboratory findings shows inflamatory markets that suggest and infectious disease.

**Polymerase-chain-reaction testing of a biopsy specimen of the eschar detected _Rickettsia japonica_. A diagnosis of Japanese spotted fever was made. After the patient completed a 2-week course of minocycline therapy, her symptoms resolved.**
