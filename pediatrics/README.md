## Pediatrics

It's evaluate a pediatric clinical case:

**An 8 month-old girl** 

> Usual weight between 8 - 10 kg*
> Usual height between 71-81 cm*

**with strabismus and developmental delay was brought to the ophthalmology clinic.**

> Strabismus: Disorder in which the eyes don't look in the same direction at the same time
> Possible cause in children
> 
> **Infantile strabismus**
> - Familial ~ 30%
> - Idiopathic (unknown)
> - Preterm birth and/or low birth weight
> - Family history of strabismus
> - Genetic disorder (e.g. Down syndrome)
> - Prenatal drug exposure
> - Congenital eye defects
> 
> **Acquired strabismus**
> - Uncorrected refractive errors
> - Cranial nerve palsy
> 	-- 3rd cranial nerve (oculomotor palsy)
>   -- 4th cranial nerve (superior oblique palsy)
>   -- 6th cranial nerve (lateral rectus palsy)
>  - Neurological conditions:
>   -- Cerebral palsy
>  -- Spina bifida
>  -- Hydrocephalus
>  -- Encephalitis/meningitis
>  -- Brain tumors
>  -- Stroke
>  -- Multiple sclerosis

>*Now we are already thinking in neurological reasons of the strabismus. The patient needs to be physical evaluated to have a better differential diagnosis.*

**Physical examination was notable for macrocephaly, intermittent exotropia in the left eye, and hypotonia.**

> Physical exam for strabismus
> - Closing or covering 1 eye when looking at a near object
> - Closing 1 eye when viewing faraway objects
> - Tilting or turning the head
> 
> Clinical history should include
> - Direction
> - Laterality
> - Frequency
> - Comitant or noncomitant

>*The physical examination provides important findings, such as the exotropia in the left eye,  hypotonia, and macrocephaly*

**A developmental history revealed all milestones to be at the 5-month-old level.**

>*Even when is not specified, the development of the girl we can evaluate her based on the criteria that some milestones are not meet accordingly to the guidelines of the denver table*

**Funduscopy examination showed macular cherry-red spots in both eyes.**

>*Since this is a case of a child with strabismus with developmental delay we should be already thinking on genetic disease, the finding of chery red spots might suggest Tay-Sachs disease*

**Referrals to the pediatric neurology and genetics department were made.**

>*The referrals were made based on two assumptions: 1) Neurological damage and possible findings on the brain; 2) Genetics disease to confirm the possible diagnosis of tay-sachs*

**Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed inadequate myelination diffusely and a thin corpus callosum.**

>*The magnetic resonance imaging of the brain support the conclusion of Tay-sachs disease*

**Whole-exome sequencing showed compound heterozygosity for pathogenic variants of the HEXA gene, a finding that confirmed a diagnosis of infantile Tay-Sachs disease.**

>*The genetics sequencing confirms the Tay-Sachs disease*

**On prenatal genetic testing, the patient's mother had been identified as a variant carrier, but her father had tested negative.**

>*This is a surprise findign since tay-sachs disease is an autosomal recessive disease-so further exploration needs to be made to identify what was the cause of the disease*

**After the patient's diagnosis, however, the father was found to carry a novel variant. Tay-Sachs disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder that results in progressive neurodegeneration**

>*This explain the findings and why it was crucial neurological evaluation as well genetic diagnosis*

**The cherry-red spot is a characteristic finding, also found in other lysosomal storage disorders, that is caused by abnormally whitened, lipid-laden neurons surrounding and accentuating the color of the normal fovea.**

>*The cherry red spot has 6 groups based on etiological factors such as:
 Vascular - Metabolic storage disease - Inflamation - Drug toxicity - Trauma*
 
**The patient  was enrolled in a clinical trial of gene therapy but subsequently had seizures and developmental arrest**

>*Unfortanely the prognosis for Tay-Sachs disease are not good, and the manage is supportive to manage symptoms and improve quality of life, or in this case can be enroled on clinical trials*
